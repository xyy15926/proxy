This directory containes setting files for $HOME, except files in
	./addon.

For convenience, all hidden file/direcotry, named with
	'^\.(.+)$' are renamed with '^\1\.$'.

Some system-dependent files, .bashrc for example, are not established.
	Instead, file-addon are created for those files, which should be
	called or included by the original files.
