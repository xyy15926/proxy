# bashrc_addon 

# this should contains some initial moves that needs to be
# done when non-login interactive shell is started, and
# should be called in ~/.bashrc(or file with another name,
# but doing the same thing), the reasons why establish this
# file rather than edit ~/.bashrc are as follows:

#	1. the name of .bashrc depends on linux release version
#	2. .bashrc may does different things
#	3. this file is not necessary

# usage:add this at the end of ~/.bashrc
#
#if [ -f ~/Code/proxy/home_config/bashrc_addon ]; then
#	. ~/Code/proxy/home_config/bashrc_addon
#fi
