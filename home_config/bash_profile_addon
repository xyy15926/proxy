# bash_profile_addon

# this should contains some initial moves that needs to be
# done when bash is invoked as an login-shell(namely when
# logining in), and should be called in ~/.bash_profile(or
# file with another name, but doing the same thing), the
# reasons why establish this file rather than edit 
# `~/.bash_profile` are as follows:

#	1. the name of .bash_profile depends on linux release
#	version
#	2. .bash_profile may does different things
#	3. this file is not necessary

# usage:add this at the end of ~/.bash_profile
#
#if [ -f ~/Code/proxy/home_config/bash_profile_addon ]; then
#	. ~/Code/proxy/home_config/bash_profile_addon
#fi

# pyenv setting
# attention:i know little about shell, but no space should
# before or after '=' 
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
# this was commented for pipenv was used instead

# set python package-searching path
export PYTHONPATH="$PAHT:$HOME/Code/pyutils"
